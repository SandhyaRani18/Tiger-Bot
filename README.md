# Tiger-Bot

As the plastic wave is constantly hitting the oceans, there is a need for certain actions that can nullify the effects of these plastics both to marine and human lives. The gateway for the plastics to enter the oceans are ocean shores. As the plastic bottles, cups etc., gets accumulated at shores, and pulled away by the ocean waves as the water passes over them. Besides, some of the plastic bottles or cups partially immersed in the sands of oceans shores, it becomes difficult to manually collect them. So , we designed a robot know as "Tiger Bot" which comes with a image recognition camera which was initially trained to certain images of plastic bottles , Cups and others which often appears on the shores. When it gets detected, it triggers the robotic arm attached infront of the robot and then it picks up those plastic trash. The tiger bot is designed as rocker bogie structure so that it can freely moves over the uneven surfaces of the ocean shores. Currently, we prototyped the defined concept and requires further add-ons like where to put the collected trash and how effectively. For this, we are planning to build bigger version of this robot with container so that the collected plastics can be stored in those containers. We used black stripes on the robot that represents the Indian national animal (White Bengal Tiger).
